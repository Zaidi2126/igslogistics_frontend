                        1IGS can also manufacture bespoke cases and crates suitable for export. All cases will comply
                        with the strict ISPM 15 requirements. <br><br>
                        We can either come to you to measure the items for packing, you can supply us with the sizes and
                        we’ll bring the cases to you for packing on-site. Alternatively, and subject to size, we can
                        bring the packed items to our facility and manufacture a case and pack.

                Bespoke crating ensures the contents are secured inside to prevent movement and damage in transit. They
                are
                ideal when shipping any forms of art, from paintings to sculptures, and perfect for shipping valuable
                items
                of furniture or antiques that require additional protection in transit. Each case is made-to-measure for
                each individual piece, or shipment to ensure your precious cargo remains as safe as possible.
