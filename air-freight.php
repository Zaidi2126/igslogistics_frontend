                    <p>
                        Our door to airport service can provide you with the choice of using your own Customs agent at
                        your airport of destination. We’ll still give you the same excellent service and updates, but
                        your agent will take over your shipment on arrival.

                    <h4>Consolidation</h4>
                    <p>
                        To benefit from improved rates, you can use our consolidated service. This is where we group
                        several Air Freight consignments for the same destination into a consolidation under one master
                        AWB. Each consignment can be issued with its own House AWB. You benefit from our consolidated
                        rate and can select a door-door or door-airport service only.

                    <h4>Out of gauge</h4>
                    <p>
                        Freight or cargo that does not fit normally in one of the standard air freight containers is
                        considered out of gauge and will often require specialist packing or a dedicated air cargo
                        service. If you have a requirement for OOG cargo, just let us know.

                    <h4>Tracking</h4>
                    <p>
                        The way we track our client’s shipment is where we are different. Many companies will provide
                        you with a tracking number which you have to enter into a website to get your own updates when
                        you feel you need an update. 1IGS will do this better. We have key stages throughout a shipments
                        progress that we send you a personalized email (or phone call) update on your air freight
                        shipment’s status. Many carrier’s websites will say ‘awaiting international Customs release’ We
                        will tell you when the entry was presented to Customs and when release can be expected. This
                        gives you not only peace of mind but a realistic time frame for when your shipment will be
                        delivered.

                    <p>
                        When you have an unusual shipment that requires a charter aircraft, we’ll check routing,
                        timescale and payload to establish the most suitable aircraft for your needs. We can offer
                        part-charters, backloads and other solutions, as you need.
                        <br><br>
                        We can supervise aircraft loading and unloading and co-ordinate the specialist equipment that
                        your shipment may need.
