                    <h4>FCL</h4>
                    <h5>Full loads – FCL</h5>
                    <p>
                        If you need a full container load, we can provide any size container that you’re looking for.
                        Most customers choose a 40’ container but we can provide a 40’ High Cube container. The
                        difference is just 12 inches or 30 cms which equates to an additional 344 cu ft of additional
                        storage. It also allows you more height to load pieces that exceed the 7’ 10” internal height of
                        a standard 40’ container.

                    <h4>LCL</h4>
                    <h5>Less Than Container Loads – LCL</h5>
                    <p>
                        Shipping by LCL (or less than a container load) allows you to share a sea freight container with
                        other shippers and as such, benefit from a shared cost as you only pay for the space you use
                        rather than the whole container.
